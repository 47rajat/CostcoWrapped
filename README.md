## How to use
1. Download your PDF receipts from Costco.
1. Save them all in a folder called `costco-receipt-pdfs`.
1. Place the folder in the same directory as `index.js`.
1. Run `node index.js`
1. Take the ouputted CSV (`costco-wrapped.csv`) and put it into Excel or Google Sheets and play around with it. See [my spreadsheet]() if you're looking for inspiration.

## How it works
`index.js` is the entry point.
